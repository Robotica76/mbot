Me Ultrasonic module is an electronic module designed for distance detection. The distance range it can detect is 3-400 cm. mBot can use this module to avoid obstacles or for other programs about distance detection. The yellow tag on the interface of this module indicates that it is a single digital interface and that it should be connected to a port with the yellow tag on the main control board.
