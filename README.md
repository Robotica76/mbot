Me Ultrasonic module is an electronic module designed for distance detection. The distance range it can detect is 3-400 cm. mBot can use this module to avoid obstacles or for other programs about distance detection. The yellow tag on the interface of this module indicates that it is a single digital interface and that it should be connected to a port with the yellow tag on the main control board.

Me Line Follower is designed for line-following robots. There are two sensors, each with an IR transmitting LED and an IR static induction phototransistor. mBot can move along a black line on a white background or a white line on a black background. It features fast detection and simple circuits. The blue tag on the interface of this module indicates that it is a dual digital interface and that it should be connected to a port with the blue tag on the main control board.
